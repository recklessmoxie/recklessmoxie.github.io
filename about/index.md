### Who am I?

 My name is Shelly Barkley, I'm a web developer currently living in Seattle, Washington.

 My boyfriend and I are big-time animal lovers and consider ourselves lucky to share our home with a cat, a dog, and 6 birds. My house is rarely quiet (or perfectly clean), but I wouldn't have it any other way. Some activities I enjoy in my spare time are:

  * Traveling
  * Photography
  * Hiking and camping
  * Writing and drawing
  * Playing retro video games
  * Exploring the PNW

My coding/programming journey is just getting started. In February 2016 I completed a few JavaScript courses through <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/"> Code Fellows</a>, which is a programming bootcamp here in Seattle.

Since my time at Code Fellows ended, I have begun self-study to further develop my programming knowledge. I am currently working through the front-end and JavaScript curriculum at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/"> Free Code Camp.</a> Hopefully I will round out my education with some freelance work before I begin to look for a full-time position somewhere.
