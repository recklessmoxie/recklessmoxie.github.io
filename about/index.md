### Who am I?

My name is Shelly Fiabane.
I'm a computer programmer/developer currently living in a suburb just outside of Seattle, Washington.

 My husband Jason and I are animal lovers who consider ourselves lucky to share our home with a cat, a dog, and 6 birds. The house is rarely quiet (or perfectly clean), but we wouldn't have it any other way.

 A few activities I enjoy in my spare time are:

  * Traveling
  * Gardening
  * Photography
  * Hiking and camping
  * Cooking
  * Writing and drawing
  * Playing video games
  * Exploring the PNW
  * Political Activism
  * Crocheting and crafting

My coding/programming journey is just beginning. In February 2016 I completed a few JavaScript courses through <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/"> Code Fellows</a>, which is a programming bootcamp here in Seattle. Since my time at Code Fellows, I have done a significant amount of self-study to further develop my programming knowledge.

Currently, I am working through the front-end and JavaScript curriculum offered by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/"> Free Code Camp.</a>

 Hopefully, I will continue to round out my education with some freelance work before I begin looking for a full-time position.
