### Project Objectives:
  * Create an app using the Open Weather API, and geolocation to display the user's current weather conditions.
  * Enable the background or an image to change based on conditions returned from the API call.
  * Allow the user to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

<p>The initial post for this project should have detailed the API's to keep information in order; However, the Trianglify and background image process was really in-depth so I chose to share it first. The remaining blog posts will be presented sequentially.</p>
